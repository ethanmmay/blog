Due to having to quarantine twice, I had a lot of remote days. I felt a lot less productive without the social aspect of the bootcamp. I do think that will be a goal for me in the close future to develop more productivity without relying on finding my motivation among others. This way I can work well independently as well as on a team. My concerns for the upcoming final project are steadily decreasing. Especially with the allotted amount of time and the resources available to me, I am confident that I can pass this test. My favorite thing about the course is the little reoccuring jokes or goofs during lecture that sometimes brings us off task and giggling. I'm slightly sad that it will be my last week next week but I'm ready to move on and encounter the next chapter of my life which will hopefully be a very short one - Job searching.")])]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("Link to Project: https://github.com/ethanmmay/checkpoint-8")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
